      <p class="text-muted">At St Cedd's School we offer pupils the opportunity to be involved in an impressive array of music-making through our extensive music curriculum and extra-curricular clubs, individual instrumental tuition, membership of an auditioned choir and  participation in one or more of our many ensembles. The School is a member of the Choir Schools' Association and we have very close links with Chelmsford Cathedral. Our choristers  are members of the Cathedral Choir, and our Junior and Senior Chamber Choirs sing at Evensong. Music is a significant aspect of our learning experience at St Cedd's School and we provide every pupil with the support they need to maximise their potential in this arena.</p>
